Hi Nathan,

We use open source TextMate-style language grammars for syntax highlighting, which are available here:
https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/grammars.yml

The fastest way to get this fixed would be to find the issue tracker for the specific grammar and open an issue or contribute a fix there.

Linguist pulls in grammar updates with each new release, which usually happens every couple of weeks. This should get fixed on GitHub.com shortly after that happens.

Cheers
Stacey
